# Cursor Rules for This Project

## Git Workflow

**NEVER commit or push without explicit user permission.**

- Always stage changes and show what will be committed
- Wait for user approval before running `git commit`
- Wait for user approval before running `git push`
- Ask: "Ready to commit?" and "Ready to push?" before each action
